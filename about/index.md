# About Me

Hey, I'm Theo (short for Theodore, long for Ted). I graduated from [Coder Academy](https://www.coderacademy.edu.au/)'s full stack web development bootcamp in August of 2021, and I've been building things professionally for the web since then. Currently, I'm building professional web things for the fine folks over at [Alembic](https://alembic.com.au/).
