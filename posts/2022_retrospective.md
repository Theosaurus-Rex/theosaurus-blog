As far as years go, 2022 was pretty eventful for me. I wanted to take the time to reflect on everything that has happened, how I've grown as both a professional and a person, and some of the things I'm looking forward to in the new year.

I don't expect this blog will be to everyone's taste - unless you know me personally or are interested in what a year as a sorta-kinda-junior developer looks like, I don't expect this will hold much interest for you. I'm cool with that - this is mostly a reflection for myself, after all, and I'm trying to just kinda...throw my thoughts out there rather than getting stuck in a self-critical spiral and never publishing any of my writing for fear of backlash. That's why I started this blog, after all.

Anyway.

Let's look at some of the most eventful milestones of my year.

## Hitting reset

If you know me (or have read some of my other articles), you'll know I graduated from Coder Academy's fullstack web developer bootcamp in August of 2021. I was incredibly fortunate to interview with a company while I was in the final weeks of the course, and after a technical interview and take-home code challenge, I was offered a position. I started the new role a week after graduation, and as a junior, I was stoked - I had landed a new job in the industry I had studied right off the bat, and I was CODING for REAL MONEY!

Unfortunately, the rose tinted glasses fell away after my initial onboarding period, and I was thrust into a chaotic emotional storm of stress, imposter syndrome, and mounting expectations. I'll probably write a separate post on what I think went wrong here, as it warrants a proper reflection on my part. For the context of this post, you just need to know that after discussing my options with HR, I decided I needed to find a new role somewhere else.
