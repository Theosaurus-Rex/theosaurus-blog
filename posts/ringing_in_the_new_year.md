It's a new year, and the perfect time to start planning my professional and personal goals for the next twelve months. If you read [my previous post](/posts/2022_retrospective) wrapping up everything I did in 2022, you'll see that I touched on a few things I'll be tackling in my professional life this year, but I wanted to take the time to properly lay out some of my personal and professional goals in a written format.

## Why share your goals on your blog?

Sharing my goals in a written format on my blog has several advantages:

- It lets people in my social circles know what I'm currently focussed on, and what type of opportunities I'm seeking
- It gives me a tangible record to revist, both for my own personal growth as well as during performance reviews in my current dev role
- It's a great way to get back into the habit of writing regularly

I recognise that sharing personal, non-technical content in a blog post isn't necessarily common practice among developers, but, in addition to the reasons above, some of my favourite developer blogs are those with content that is skewed more toward sharing the developer's personal experiences, both programming related and otherwise. [Jason Lengstorf](https://www.jason.af/posts/) has one of my all-time favourite blogs, and is one of few I read on a regular basis. He shares many anecdotes from his personal developer journey which are not only entertaining to read, but almost always leave me with a new grain of wisdom.

I'd much rather try to replicate the style of writing that I admire than deliver dry, purely technical content. That's why I built this blog in the first place - rather than continuing to post on Dev.to and limit myself to purely technical content, I wanted a space where I was free to share my thoughts on whatever topic pleases me. After sharing some of my posts with friends and colleagues, people generally seem to enjoy this style of writing, which gives me one more reason to keep sharing things on here as I see fit.

With all of that said, I want to share my first goal - blog more.

## Keeping a Consistent Writing Habit

While I love writing, it's never been something I've been able to consistently maintain a habit of doing. Much like in software development, writing things down has become a kind of afterthought in my day to day life as opposed to a tool that can be used to structure learning, thinking, and new experiences. This is something I am going to try my best to change this year, by continuing to maintain posts on this blog.

Previously, there have been two main roadblocks stopping me from writing more frequently - lack of confidence, and lack of time.

### Why do I care what people think of my writing?

Entering the tech industry was a huge trajectory shift from my previous studies at art school, and along with that change came a healthy dose of imposter syndrome. Unfortunately, as many far more experienced devs have informed me, that feeling is one that lingers throughout your entire career as a developer - you just have to find ways to live alongside it without sacrificing your mental health.

Since starting my developer career, imposter syndrome has not only been a constant companion, but a roadblock that more often than not has stopped me from sharing my writing with others. Unfortunately, I have the additional setback of not being born a cishet man, which means that when I _do_ overcome my own internalised scrutiny and share something I've made online, there are many people more than willing to scrutinise instead. Unfortunately being openly queer means that this usually comes in the form of targeted harassment - I've been told to stick a fork in an electrical outlet more than once after sharing a tech-related opinion online - to a degree that many cishet male developers simply don't experience.

It's taken me a while to realise that, regardless of the content I post, simply daring to exist as an openly queer indivdual within a male-dominated industry is going to mean I'm a target no matter what. The quality of my work has no bearing on this - I could write the best and most thoroughly researched article and I'm sure there would still be snide comments made questioning my knowledge and capability. I'm choosing to embrace that.

See, knowing that this is the case has made me realise that I simply don't have to care what people think of my work. Knowing that I could write something that I feel is the perfect blog and still have targeted harassment thrown my way as a result has made me realise that I can share my work without it being perfect. There is no consequence to sharing my thoughts online, because the result is the same every time. Knowing this and continuing to hold it in the back of my mind as I share my writing has become the key to tearing down this particular mental barrier.

### Making time for personal development
