It's a new year, and the perfect time to start planning my professional and personal goals for the next twelve months. If you read [my previous post](/posts/2022_retrospective) wrapping up everything I did in 2022, you'll see that I touched on a few things I'll be tackling in my professional life this year, but I wanted to take the time to properly lay out some of my personal and professional goals in a written format.

## Why share your goals on your blog?

Sharing my goals in a written format on my blog has several advantages:

- It lets people in my social circles know what I'm currently focussed on, and what type of opportunities I'm seeking
- It gives me a tangible record to revist, both for my own personal growth as well as during performance reviews in my current dev role
- It's a great way to get back into the habit of writing regularly

I recognise that sharing personal, non-technical content in a blog post isn't necessarily common practice among developers, but, in addition to the reasons above, some of my favourite developer blogs are those with content that is skewed more toward sharing the developer's personal experiences, both programming related and otherwise. [Jason Lengstorf](https://www.jason.af/posts/) has one of my all-time favourite blogs, and is one of few I read on a regular basis. He shares many anecdotes from his personal developer journey which are not only entertaining to read, but almost always leave me with a new grain of wisdom.

I'd much rather try to replicate the style of writing that I admire than deliver dry, purely technical content. That's why I built this blog in the first place - rather than continuing to post on Dev.to and limit myself to purely technical content, I wanted a space where I was free to share my thoughts on whatever topic pleases me. After sharing some of my posts with friends and colleagues, people generally seem to enjoy this style of writing, which gives me one more reason to keep sharing things on here as I see fit.

With all of that said, I want to share my first goal - blog more.

## Keeping a Consistent Writing Habit

While I love writing, it's never been something I've been able to consistently maintain a habit of doing. Much like in software development, writing things down has become a kind of afterthought in my day to day life as opposed to a tool that can be used to structure learning, thinking, and new experiences. This is something I am going to try my best to change this year, by continuing to maintain posts on this blog.

Previously, there have been two main roadblocks stopping me from writing more frequently - lack of confidence, and lack of time.

### Why do I care what people think of my writing?

Paragraph about letting go of what other people think of my blog posts.

### Making time for personal development

Talk about prioritising time for personal development outside of work and using writing blogs as a tool for this.
