# Before we begin, a disclaimer

For all intents and purposes, this is a fun little joke post designed to be entertaining while honing my design thinking and writing skills. My opinions of Andrew Tate in no way reflect my employer's opinions (although let's be real if they liked Andrew Tate they probably wouldn't hire me). My opinions and critiques of the website content and design are entirely my own.

# Why Andrew Tate's website?

If you read my [previous post](/posts/ringing_in_the_new_year.md), you'll know I'm currently in the lead up to studying a product design program. I've been doing a bunch of research in the meantime, and most recently, I've been learning about how to properly critique designs. In particular, I've been looking at how app critiques are conducted during interviews for design positions, but I feel as though practicing across various websites outside of a interview setting is a great way to practice as well as fun content to share here in a written format.

I was chatting with my friend Brett, who originally directed me towards the course I'll be taking, when he asked me a question that catalysed this blog post: "Have you seen Andrew Tate's website?".
_Oh god_, I thought, _I'm going to need a glass of wine for this_.

Andrew Tate, for those who have been living under a rock, is a self-described "Light-Heavyweight Kickboxing World Champion", but also a really big douchebag. He's been in the news lately for [being arrested after getting into a flame war with Greta Thunberg](https://www.newsweek.com/how-andrew-tate-beef-greta-thunberg-led-his-arrest-romania-pizza-boxes-1770305), and being [charged with alleged rape and human trafficking](https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/1/4/23539528/andrew-tate-arrest-jail-rape-human-trafficking). It's a whole thing. So I'm sure you can imagine the glass of wine was very much a necessity as I dove into the absolute mess of his [personal grifting website](https://www.cobratate.com/).

So, wine in hand, I said "Fuck it, I'm writing a blog post on why this is a poorly designed and executed site.", and now you're here, dear reader!

# Ok nerd, what even is a design critique?
